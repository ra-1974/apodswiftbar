# apodswiftbar

This is a SwiftBar plugin for displaying the NASA picture of the day
found at https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html. 

It requires python3, and [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/).

It is a fork of the [apod plugin for bibar](https://github.com/jakevossen5/apodbitbar/tree/master) 
and then expanded.

More about SwiftBar on [their website](https://swiftbar.app).
